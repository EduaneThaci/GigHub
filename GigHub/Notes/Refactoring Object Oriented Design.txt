                Anemic Domain Model
Is the use of a software domain model where the domain objects contain little 
or no business logic(validations, calculations,business rules etc...).

                 Cohesion

This principle means that things that are highly related with each other 
should be together(better in one method).


 //Objects always should be in the valid state.


            What is Factory Method Pattern?
In Factory pattern, we create the object without exposing the creation logic.
In this pattern, an interface is used for creating an object, but let subclass decide which
class to instantiate. The creation of object is done when it is required.
The Factory method allows a class later instantiation to subclasses.

In short, factory method design pattern abstract the process of object creation and allows 
the object to be created at run-time when it is required.
