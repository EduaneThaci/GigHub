                  SQL INJECTION

Sql Injection allows attackers to execute malicious SQL STATEMENTS in our application.

For example:
If we have an line like this in our application:

   var query="Select * from users where userID="+userID;

   In this case the userID is an input that will be supplied from user and if he/she write
   1234 or 1=1
   it will extract all the users because of second part of input ,1=1 is always true.

   The solution:
   var query="Select * from users where userID=@userID";




                       CROSS SITE SCRIPTING-XSS

 Allows attackers to execute malicious SCRIPT on the victim's computer.
 Depending on the sophistication of the attack, the attackers can access on the geolocation,
 web cam of users etc.

       How it works:
	   The attacker will supply for example the input name with any of them malicious script.
	         Name: <script>...</script>
	   Where the victim visits this page,this malicious script is loaded and executed.


	   How to prevent:
	     Escaping content:
		    which tells the browser to treat the content as the simple string
			     Raw:
				    <script>
				Escaped:
				    &lt;script&gt;


       
	   By default:
	     ASP.NET rejects Javascript in inputs
		 Razor views escape content:
		    -Exception:
			    Html.Raw();






				CROSS SITE REQUEST FORGERY(CSRF)
Allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.


   How it Works: 
    Example:
		The victim:
			Will log in into the paypal account and will transfer money in another account.
			In the body of the request will be the targetAccount:4503 and the amount:1000

		The attacker:
			Will create a malicious website and will redirect somehow the victim in that 
			website.
			If the victim press the button supposed to press,the targetAccount will be change 
			to the attacker account and all the money will be transfer there.



	Preventing CSRF attack:
	    1.
			@using (Html.BeginForm())
			{
			  @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
			}

		2.
			[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
			public ActionResult Create(){}
