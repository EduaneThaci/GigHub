A template processor (also known as a template engine or template parser) is 
software designed to combine templates with a data model to produce result documents.

Razor is one of them.
Underscore.js
etc...

Those templates enable us to use logic within markup languange.



                  Underscore.js as template engine

Everything you need to know about underscore template. Only 3 things to keep in mind:

<%  %> - to execute some code
<%= %> - to print some value in template
<%- %> - to print some values HTML escaped
That's all about it.

Simple example:

var tpl = _.template("<h1>Some text: <%= foo %></h1>");
then tpl({foo: "blahblah"}) would be rendered to the string <h1>Some text: blahblah</h1>
